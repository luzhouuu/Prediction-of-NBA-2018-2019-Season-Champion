# Prediction of NBA 2018-2019 Season Championship
The National Basketball Association (NBA) consists of 30 professional teams located in major cities across the United States and Canada, and divides its season into three major parts: the Regular Season, the Playoffs and the Finals. The top 8 teams in the Reagular season from Western and Eastern respectively will be prompted to the playoffs, and the naissance of NBA Championship will rise in every June. 

Apparently, the team with the best performance will win the Championship including offense and defense, and I believe these performance could be refelected in the stats. Therefore, I decide to use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to fit the past 30 yearsâ€™ Palyoffs and predict the Champion of the current season (2018-2019) (We Are Basket, 2019).
